# "LOLIOT"

With the Internet of Things (IoT) quickly growing, manufacturers are pressured to release their products to market as soon as possible in order to keep up with competitors. Innovation and affordability are widely prioritized over basic security considerations as developers rush to get their designs into the hands of enterprises and consumers. Improving the state of IoT security in the future will depend on contributions from experts who understand the common pitfalls and their solutions.

The “LOLIOT” (Logging of Local Internal Office Temperature) project was conceived as an educational exercise to encourage consultants to go beyond simply hacking and think about IoT from the developer’s perspective, potentially honing new skills along the way. In addition to designing and building the system LOLIOT provides an opportunity for consultants to build upon the basic design and continue hardening and attacking with further iterations, either alone or with a group, to study how usability and functionality goals clash with security objectives.
